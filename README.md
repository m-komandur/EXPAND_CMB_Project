This repository contains the Python code for my research project on the Cosmic Microwave Background through my participation in the [UC San Diego School of Physical Sciences EXPAND Program](https://center.ucsd.edu/mentor-village/expand). 

Use [EXPAND_CMB_Python_notebook.ipynb](EXPAND_CMB_Python_notebook.ipynb) to view the code. This file also contains some of my notes and analysis of the functions I utilized and the information they output. 

By working with a graduate mentor in EXPAND, I learned to use some of Python's essential astronomical libraries such as **astropy** and **healpy** to open and visualize CMB Temperature Maps and to interpret them with properties 
such as angular resolution and pixelization by utilizing functions in `healpy.pixelfunc`. I also learned to compute the Power Spectrum from a CMB Temperature map using 
advanced mathematical functions, such as `hp.anafast` and `np.fft.fft`.
